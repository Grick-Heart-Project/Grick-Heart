# Grick-Heart-Bot

This is a Discord Bot designed for use while playing D&D. It is currently under heavy development, so please create an issue if you find a bug!

# Current Commands

Grick Heart currently has a few commands:

  - !roll d<4,6,8,10,12,20,100> - This command rolls and returns a number corresponding to the size of dice you specify.
  - !spell <spellname> - This command looks up the spell that you specify and returns with the information found on that spell.
  - !init <argument> - This command is currently in beta, but basically it handles initiative, including initiative rolls with modifiers.
  - !table <argument> - This command adds and removes players from the game table at the discretion of the DM
  - !help - This command sends help messages directly to the player
